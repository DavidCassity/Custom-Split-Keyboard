# The Zesty
 Custom Split Keyboard using Ergogen and KiCAD

FUTURE ITERATION:
-Include additional double wide key underneath the middle and index columns
-Make the on off switch connect VCC to RAW since I don't have any idle power draw components
-Remap nets to more intuitive pins to decrease routing hell and vias
-ACTUALLY USE THE THREE FREE PINS I HAVE LOL
