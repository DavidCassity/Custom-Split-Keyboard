# The Zesty
 Custom Split Keyboard using Ergogen and KiCAD

FUTURE ITERATION:
- Include a double-wide key underneath the middle and index columns
- ~~Make the on off switch connect VCC to RAW since I don't have any idle power draw components~~
- ~~Remap nets to more intuitive pins to decrease routing hell and vias~~
- order new pcbs (once above are complete)
- buy another button and switch
